    <h1>Something about me</h1>
    <h2>Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Michael, I live in Turin and currently student at Strive. <br>
    I'm an extrovert that enjoy silly things, being with friends and playing videogames.
    </p>

    <h2>Things I love to do</h2>
    
    <h3>Urbex</h3>
    <p>Urbex, or more simply Urban Exploration, is a photography style. Consisting in visiting abandoned structures and take photos, I've explored many places and took so many pictures. Sometimes is spooky but that's the fun part.

    <h3>Fencing</h3>
    <p>Yeah, I practiced historical fencing for a long period of time, There's something in beat people with a giant axe in full armor that I can't explain. It's a beautiful sport and sometimes I really miss it</p>

    <h3>Videogames</h3>
    <p>I really love videogames, I play from when I was 10. I don't just like playing, I really like everything that concern the videogame, so much that one day I hope to be able to create something made by me
